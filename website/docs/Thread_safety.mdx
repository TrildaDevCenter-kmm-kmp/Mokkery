# Thread safety

Mocks created using Mokkery are generally considered "thread safe" in the context of their usage in a
 multithreaded environment. It means that calling methods on configured mock from different threads is safe.

**However, configuration operations (e.g. `every`, `everySuspend`) and
verification operations (e.g. `verify`, `verifySuspend`) are not thread-safe.
These operations should be performed from a single thread!**

Also, make sure that any defined matcher/answer does not perform any not synchronized side effects. Example below
shows this kind of side effect.

```kotlin
var x: Int = 0
every { mock.getAndIncrement() } calls { x++ }
```

To synchronize it, you can use [atomic-fu](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-atomicfu):

```kotlin
var x = atomic<Int>(0)
every { mock.getAndIncrement() } calls { x.getAndIncrement() }
```
