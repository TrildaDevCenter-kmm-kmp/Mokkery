# Debugging

Mokkery provides tools to simplify debugging in your tests.

## Mock state

You can print the state of a mock using `printMokkeryDebug`:

```kotlin
val mock = mock<Foo>()
// ...
printMokkeryDebug(mock)
```
This produces a JSON-like structure printed with `println`:

```
mock {
	id = your.package.Foo(1)
	mode = strict
	answers {
		call(input = any()) returns -1
		call(input = 1) returns 2
		call(input = 2) returns 4
		call(input = 3) returns 6
	}
	calls {
		call(input = 0)
		call(input = 1)
		call(input = 2)
	}
}
```

You can also create this debug string manually using `mokkeryDebugString` and process it as needed.

## Logging calls

To log each call to a mock, use `MokkeryCallLogger`:

```kotlin
private val logger = MokkeryCallLogger()

@BeforeTest
fun before() {
    MokkeryCallInterceptor.beforeAnswering.register(logger)
}

@AfterTest
fun after() {
    MokkeryCallInterceptor.beforeAnswering.unregister(logger)
}
```
This approach ensures the logger is added only for the duration of a single test class.

For quick debugging, you can simply use:

```kotlin
MokkeryCallInterceptor.beforeAnswering.register(MokkeryCallLogger())
```
