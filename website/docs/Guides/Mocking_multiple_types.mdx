# Mocking multiple types

To create a mock of multiple types use `mockMany`:

```kotlin
val mock = mockMany<A, B, C>()
```

`mockMany` accepts up to 5 types. These types have to satisfy given requirements:
* Each type must be [supported](../Limitations#supported-types).
* Types must not duplicate.
* Single super class is allowed.
* Functional types are not supported on JS.

`mockMany` returns `MockManyN` type that is a marker for multiple type mocks. To access methods from specific type, explicit cast is required.
You can achive it with `tN` extensions:

```kotlin
val mock = mockMany<A, B, C> {
    // t1 extension casts to A
    every { t1.methodFromA() } returns Unit
    // t2 extension casts to B
    every { t2.methodFromB() } returns Unit
    // t3 extension casts to C
    every { t3.methodFromC() } returns Unit
}

val foo = Foo(a = mock.t1)
```

### Shared methods

If types share methods with the same signature, they are threated as one:

```kotlin
interface A {
    // ...
    fun sharedMethod(i: Int): String
}
interface B {
    // ...
    fun sharedMethod(i: Int): String
}
// ...
val mock = mockMany<A, B> {
    every { t1.sharedMethod(any()) } returns "Hello world!"
}
// ...
mock.t2.sharedMethod(1) // returns "Hello world!"
```
