description: Easily create a spy from a real object!

# Spying

To create a spy use `spy` with spied object as a parameter.

> :warning: **Please read [limitations](../Limitations) section!**

```kotlin
val repository = BookRepositoryImpl()
val spiedRepository = spy<BookRepository>(repository)
```
Ensure that you specify a type for the `spy`. In previous example inferred type would be `BookRepositoryImpl`,
which is very likely to be a final class, and it is not supported to spy them!

By default, spy delegates all calls to spied object. However, you can change methods behaviour in [the same way as with mocks](../Guides/Mocking).

Read [verifying](../Guides/Verifying) section to learn how to verify calls on spy!
