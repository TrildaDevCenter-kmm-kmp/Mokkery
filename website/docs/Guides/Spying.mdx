# Spying

Similarly to `mock`, `spy` tracks method calls. However, it is not possible to change spy behavior. It always calls spied object
method.

> :warning: **Please read [limitations](../Limitations) section!**

```kotlin
val repository = BookRepositoryImpl()
val spiedRepository = spy<BookRepository>(repository)
```
Ensure that you specify a type for the `spy`. In previous example inferred type would be `BookRepositoryImpl`,
which is very likely to be a final class, and it is not supported to spy them!

Read [verifying](../Guides/Verifying) section to learn how to verify calls on spy!
